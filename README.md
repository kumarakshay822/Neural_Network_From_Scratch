# Neural_Network_From_Scratch
# Description:-
A customized Neural Network class for classification tasks. The class implements regularization and eases the application of regularization to the neural network. Dependencies include the numpy library. The following are the descriptions of the important funcation of the class.


# gradientDescent:-
It preforms Gradient Descent with iters as no. of iterations, alpha as the learning rate and lambda as regularization factor.

# Predict:-
It performs Forward Propogation on the Neural Network to classify the input.

# getCostAndGradient:-
It performs Backward Porpogation to calculate the gradients for each parameter
